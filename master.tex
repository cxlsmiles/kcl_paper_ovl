%% Meta-data block
%% ---------------
%% Each author should be given as a separate \author command.
%%
%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author
%% name as an \email command. Phone and fax numbers can be given
%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional.
%%
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each
%% \affiliation command applies to all preceding authors not already
%% assigned an affiliation.
%%
%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This
%% will typically be something like "University of Somewhere".
%%
%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc.
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.

%Some journals require a graphical entry for the Table of Contents.
%This should be laid out ``print ready'' so that the sizing of the
%text is correct.
%
%Inside the \texttt{tocentry} environment, the font used is Helvetica
%8\,pt, as required by \emph{Journal of the American Chemical
%Society}.
%
%The surrounding frame is 9\,cm by 3.5\,cm, which is the maximum
%permitted for  \emph{Journal of the American Chemical Society}
%graphical table of content entries. The box will not resize if the

%This box and the associated title will always be printed on a
