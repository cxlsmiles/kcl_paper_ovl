%% Each author should be given as a separate \author command.

%% Corresponding authors should have an e-mail given after the author
%% name as an \email command. Phone and fax numbers can be given
%% using \phone and \fax, respectively; this information is optional.
%%
%% The affiliation of authors is given after the authors; each
%% \affiliation command applies to all preceding authors not already
%% assigned an affiliation.
%%
%% The affiliation takes an option argument for the short name.  This
%% will typically be something like "University of Somewhere".

%% The \altaffiliation macro should be used for new address, etc.
%% On the other hand, \alsoaffiliation is used on a per author basis
%% when authors are associated with multiple institutions.

, contrary to what one would expect for a Rydberg series \citep{hussain07:022710}(MORE REF?) and contrary to what is observed for \ki. This phenomenon can be understood by the more compact radial density distribution of the excited electron in the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$5p state compared to that of the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p state shown in Fig.\ \ref{fg:rdens_ions}. As a result of this, the overlap between the core electron and the more compact 5p orbital becomes larger, and thus the oscillator strength of the transition.
