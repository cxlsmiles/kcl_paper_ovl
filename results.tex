\subsection{Normal Auger decay}\label{ssec:na}

The KL$_{2,3}$L$_{2,3}$ normal Auger decay following K-shell ionization in \ki~and \cli~\denis{is the main non radiative relaxation chanel and it} results in the population of 2p$^{-2}$($^3$P, $^1$D, $^1$S) final states. The $^3$P final state has low intensity since it is forbidden {\color{red}from parity conservation rules} (REF: Volker Schmidt book??) and is not clearly observed in the present experimental data due to its overlap with the 2p$^{-2}$($^{1}$D)nl dispersive states. In the case of Cl$^{-}_{\text{aq}}$, the lines corresponding to the Cl$^{+}$ (2p$^{-2}$) $^1$S and $^1$D states are located at 2373.2\,eV and 2382.1\,eV kinetic energy (see Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_cl}). For K$^{+}_{\text{aq}}$ the maxima of the $^1$S and $^1$D KL$_{2,3}$L$_{2,3}$ Auger lines are located at 2958\,eV and 2968.4\,eV, respectively (see Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_k}). 


The KL$_{2,3}$L$_{2,3}$ Auger lines are not supposed to disperse with photon energy except close to threshold due to the interaction between the photoelectron and Auger electron, i.e.\ the so-called post-collision interaction (PCI). As a result of this interaction, first, the peaks in the Auger spectrum become asymmetric with a shoulder at high kinetic energies, and second, they are shifted to higher kinetic energies close to threshold \citep{russek86:911,guillemin15:012503}. Consequently, one can attribute the high kinetic energy shoulder of the $^1$D and $^1$S peaks on Figs.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_k} and \ref{fg:2dmap_cl} as resulting from a PCI effect. In order to minimize this effect we recorded the KLL Auger spectrum of both Cl$^{-}_{\text{aq}}$ and K$^{+}_{\text{aq}}$ at higher photon energies, $h\nu = 5$\,keV (see Ref.\ \citep{ceolin17} for details). The maxima of the $^1$D and $^1$S states were found at 2381.1\,eV and 2372.3\,eV for Cl$^{-}_{\text{aq}}$, and 2967.4\,eV and 2957\,eV kinetic energy for K$^{+}_{\text{aq}}$, respectively. The lines observed at photon energies far from threshold and close to it appear to be shifted by $\sim$1\,eV. The magnitude of the shift is the same for both ions, thus, we can conclude that it does not depend on the initial charge of the ion. The observed PCI shift of 1\,eV is larger than in the case of the isoelectronic Ar, where its value is $\sim$0.5\,eV at a photon energy of 10 \,eV above 1s ionization threshold \citep{guillemin15:012503}. The shift in the energies of the photo- and Auger electrons is proportional to the change in the ionic field during the Auger process. In a solution, both the single and double ionization potentials change due to the polarization of the water molecules and the stabilization of the ionic species through ion-dipole interaction with the polarized solvent. For example, in \ki, the ionization potential of the bare ion was experimentally determined to be 3619.4\,eV \citep{hertlein06:062715}, whereas in an aqueous solution, its value drops by about 7.5\,eV. The magnitude of this effect increases with the ionic charge, consequently, there will be an even greater difference for the double ionization potential. Thus, one can expect a larger change in the ionic field in an aqueous solution compared to that in a van der Waals cluster, which can, therefore, account for the large PCI shift of the Auger lines in a solution.


The normal Auger $^1$D main line of K$^{+}$ differs from that of Cl$^{-}$ by the presence of a large shoulder (A on Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_k}) on the low kinetic energy side at about 2965\,eV kinetic energy. This shoulder is a result of charge transfer from the solvent molecules \citep{ceolin17}. Charge-transfer-to-solvent states \denis{were calculated to be present} in \cli, but were found at lower kinetic energies, and are therefore not observed in the kinetic energy region shown on Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_cl} \citep{ceolin17}.


\subsection{Resonant Auger decay} \label{ssec:ra}

The pre-edge regions of the x-ray absorption spectra of \ki~and \cli~shown to the left on Figs.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_k} and \ref{fg:2dmap_cl} do not exhibit any high intensity features {\color{red}Here, I mean sharp resonances if it's called like this, compared to Ar for example}. Consequently, solely from these spectra, one cannot conclude whether there are core-excited states in the pre-edge structure, which can undergo resonant Auger decay. Due to the lifetime broadening and energetic proximity of the core excited states to the ionization thresholds they do not appear as separate peaks. However, one can determine their excitation energies from the maxima of the resonant Auger features. Thus, for \cli, the lowest core excited state is located at 2825.2\,eV, which agrees very well with the position of the Cl$^{-}$ 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p excitation determined from Cl K-edge XAS experiments in MgCl$_2$.6H$_2$O and of SrCl$_2$/SrCl$_2$.6H$_2$O \citep{sugiura82:681} and MCl$_{4}^{-}$ compounds \citep{shadle95:2259}. In the case of \ki, there are two dispersive features with maxima at photon energies of 3611.2\,eV (B) and 3611.6\,eV (C), respectively (Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_k}). The positions of these two core excited states are close to the energy of the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p excitation in bare \ki, 3610.7\,eV \citep{hertlein06:062715}.


Unlike the normal Auger decay, which proceeds in a fairly similar way in the two ions, the resonant Auger features appear to be quite different for \cli~and \ki. In the spectrum of \cli~shown in Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_cl} there are two dispersive features on the high kinetic energy side of the main $^1$S and $^1$D lines, i.e.\ at 2825.2\,eV photon energy and 2374.6 and 2383.4\,eV kinetic energy. In the case of \ki, only a dispersive feature close to the $^1$D main peak is observed (feature B) with a maximum located at $h\nu = $3611.2 \,eV and 2969.2 \,eV kinetic energy. An additional feature appears as a separate island away from the main lines on the 2D map of \ki. It is located at $h\nu = $3611.6\,eV and 2978.1\,eV kinetic energy (feature C), thus it is separated by approximately 400\,meV photon energy and 8.3\,eV kinetic energy from the feature B. \denis{I think we should be careful here for potassium: the dispersive line exists close to the 1S but due to several factors (background?, presence of CT state, we do not see it clearly as in the chloride case}.
%Unlike in the case Cl$^{-}$ the dispersive feature close to the $^1$S main line is not observed in K$^{+}$ due to presence of a strong {\color{red}background (@DENIS?)}. 


%In order to get a better understanding of these features, we will first consider the Auger spectrum of the isoelectronic Ar presented in Refs.\ \citep{ceolin15:022502,guillemin15:012503}. 

%First, from the 2D map of Ar one can extract information about the nature of the core excited states below threshold. The pre-edge structure in the XAS spectrum of Ar consists of the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p and 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$5p excitations. Higher core excited states cannot be identified in the XAS spectrum due to their lifetime broadening and proximity to the ionization threshold. The same excitations were observed in the XAS spectrum of bare \ki~ions \citep{hertlein06:062715}. Again, the identification of 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$np states with n$\,>\,$5 was not possible in the case of \ki.

%Second, the 2D map of Ar carries information about the states populated in the resonant Auger processes following core excitation. In the case of Ar, the Ar 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p and 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$5p core excited states undergo both pure spectator and shake-up resonant Auger decay leading to the population of Ar$^{2+}$(2p$^{-2}$np) (n$ = 4 - 6$) final states. As a result, apart from the main Ar$^{2+}(2p^{-2})$ $^1$D and $^1$S lines which result from normal Auger decay, additional dispersive features are observed. For example, the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p core excited state undergoes both pure spectator and shake-up resonant Auger decay. The former results in an island shifted with respect to the main $^1$D line by $\sim$4-5\,eV kinetic energy, whereas the fingerprint of the shake-up process is a feature appearing at the same kinetic energy as the  main $^1$D line. Moreover, the intensities of the observed shake-up features are lower compared to those of the pure spectator Auger decay. In aqueous solutions, one can expect the 2D map to be fairly different as both the initial core excited states and the final Auger states will be influenced by the presence of the solvent.

The theoretical stick spectra were convolved with a Lorentzian profile of FWHM 0.74\,eV for \ki~and 0.62\,eV for \cli~in order to account for the lifetime broadening. The stick spectrum corresponds to the projections $|a_{nl}^{i}|^2$ of the SONOs corresponding to the core excited states of the 6-coordinated clusters on the basis of SONOs corresponding to the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$3d, 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p, and 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$5p states in the bare K$^+$ and \cli~ions (Eq.\ \ref{eq:sono_proj}). The theoretical XAS spectra of \ki~were shifted to higher photon energies by 6.7\,eV, which corresponds to the difference between the computed and experimental core excitation energies of the 1s $\rightarrow$ 4p excitation in the bare ion taken from Ref.\ \citep{hertlein06:062715}.}\denis{We have to write clearly K+ and Cl- in the figure (inside the purple and green circles for instance. Also, can we add as a dooted line, the result of your calculation convoluted with Gaussians corresponding to experimental resolution? And a line indicating the IP? I remenber there was a story with the IP calculation but maybe we should say few words about the evolution of the IP as a function of the number of water molecules, i.e. core-excited states and IP get closer and closer when the number of H2O increases.}
\label{fg:xas_kcl}
\end{figure}


In order to rationalize the pre-edge region of the experimental XAS spectra and the differences in the AES spectra of \ki$_{\text{aq}}$ and \cli$_{\text{aq}}$, we computed the lowest core-excited states of the bare \ki~and \cli~ions and their hexa-coordinated clusters \denis{at a specific geometry which corresponds to??}. The theoretical XAS spectra are presented in Fig.\ \ref{fg:xas_kcl}. In the bare ions (lowermost panels on Fig.\ \ref{fg:xas_kcl}), the lowest energy peak corresponds to the dipole allowed 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p state. The next dipole allowed state, 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$5p, is located 4.3\,eV and 10.8\,eV higher in the cases of \ki~and \cli, respectively. Together with the two dipole allowed transitions, we show the dipole forbidden 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$3d state on the XAS spectra of the bare ions. It is noteworthy that the positions of the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p and 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$3d states are inverted in \ki~and \cli. In the case of Cl$^{-}$ the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p excitation has lower energy and the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$3d excitation is close to the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$5p state. On the contrary, in K$^{+}$ the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$3d excitation has lower energy and lies below the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p state. We note in passing that the intensity of the Cl$^{-}$(1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p) state is lower than that of the \cli(1s$\,\rightarrow\,$5p) state contrary to what is observed in \ki. This difference can be explained with the lower electron density of the 4p compared to the 5p electron in the region close to the core hole which thus results in the lower oscillator strength of the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p compared to the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$5p transition in \cli~(see Fig.\ \ref{fg:rdens_ions}).

%\nico{I would first discuss the clusters results and then state that we consider only the lowest peak.}

The water molecules in the first solvation shell have several effects on the core excited states. First, upon addition of water molecules, the degeneracy of the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p state is lifted and the intensity of the resulting states in the cluster drops. Moreover, the character of these states changes -- they are no longer of pure atomic character but they rather interact with states of the neighboring water molecules (shown as grey bars) and with other closely lying states of the bare ion, such as the dipole allowed 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$5p and dipole forbidden 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$3d state. Thus, the latter also acquire intensity in the cluster due to mixing with the dipole allowed states in the ligand field of the solvent. A similar effect was observed in the XAS spectra of microsolvated clusters of Na$^{+}$ and Mg$^{2+}$ \citep{miteva16:16671}.

Further we assume that only the lowest peak in the theoretical XAS spectra \denis{of the solvated ions of bare ion??} is populated during the experiment for two reasons. First, due to the lifetime broadening, it spreads over approximately 2\,eV which coincides with the width of the pre-edge structure in the experimental XAS spectra \denis{there are no clear structure in the XAS. Do you think about the width of the islands in the 2D map instead?}. Second, the splitting between the first core-excited state and the ionization threshold in the experiment is 0.7\,eV for \ki~and 0.2\,eV for \cli, and thus is smaller than the splitting between the first and second peak in the theoretical spectra (1.5\,eV for \ki~and $\sim$3\,eV for \cli, Fig.\ \ref{fg:xas_kcl}). In the 6-coordinated cluster (Fig.\ \ref{fg:xas_kcl} upper left panel), which represents the complete first solvation shell around \ki, the lowest peak in the spectrum contains three states. The lowest and highest lying states are split by approximately 0.5\,eV and they have mixed 4p and 5p character. \denis{We note that in this photon energy region, the photon bandwidth is about 0.4eV, comparable with the energy splitting between these two states}. The low intensity state in between these two states has a predominantly 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$3d character. Since the dispersive feature B appears at lower excitation energies compared to the feature C, we assume that it is produced in the resonant Auger decay of the lowest core excited states of \ki, which are predominantly of 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p character. Moreover, we can attribute the feature C to the resonant Auger decay of the low intensity dipole forbidden 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$3d state. Thus, we explain both the energy splitting of $\sim$400\,meV photon energy of the two features, and the fact that island C has lower intensity than feature B.
\denis{I like this interpretation. Actually, we skip the shake up explanation of 3d to 4p which is not too bad. Do we need to say few words about the 4s and why we do not take it into account in the discussion?}


In the hexa-coordinated cluster of \cli, the solvent molecules have little influence on the position and character of the first peak. Since there are no other ionic states close the the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p state in the ion, this state preserves its character in the cluster and interacts with states of the nearest water molecules. We attribute the two dispersive features on the 2D map of \cli~to the resonant Auger decay of this core excited state \denis{As I said before, the two dispersive features are coming from 1S and 1D. but actually there is only one dispersive feature / spectroscopic term}. {\color{red}Since the photon energy step in the experimental spectrum coincides with the splitting between the two dispersive features, we assume that they originate from the decay of the same core excited state.}\denis{I don't understand the red sentence}.


To fully characterize the dispersive features on the experimental 2D maps, we also computed the lowest K$^{2+}$(2p$^{-2}$nl) and Cl$^{0}$(2p$^{-2}$nl) states of the bare ions corresponding to the lowest final spectator resonant Auger states. They are shown as bars in the upper panels on the experimental resonant Auger spectra on Figs.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_k} and \ref{fg:2dmap_cl}. In both cases of \ki~and \cli, we shifted the lowest 2p$^{-2}$4p states such that they coincide with the maxima of the dispersive features on the high kinetic energy part of the $^1$D main line. Out of all final states we show only the doublets assuming that the quartet states are populated with a very low probability (REFS). The 2p$^{-2}$nl states of \ki~and \cli~are substantially different and they reflect the fact that the 3d unoccupied orbitals of \denis{bare} \ki~are lower than the 4p orbitals, which is the opposite of what is observed in \cli.


%As mentioned above, we assume that the island B is produced in the decay of the lowest lying core excited state of the hexa-hydrated \ki~cluster, which is of predominantly 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p character. 
As mentioned above, we attribute the island B to the decay of the lowest lying core excited state of the hexa-hydrated \ki~cluster, which is of predominantly 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p character. 
Supposing that this state undergoes mostly pure spectator resonant Auger decay, which is the case of the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p state in the isoelectronic Ar atom \citep{ceolin15:022502}, then the lowest states of 2p$^{-2}$4p character located between 2969 and 2970\,eV are populated in this case. As can be seen from the Auger electron spectrum at $h\nu = $3610.7\,eV (upper panel of Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_k}), the lowest 2p$^{-2}$4p states of \ki~are separated by 5 and 13\,eV from the lowest 2p$^{-2}$3d states. Thus, the lower-kinetic energy group of 2p$^{-2}$3d states almost coincides with the position of the island C. Consequently, we attribute \denis{confirm instead of attribute? since we already conclude before that the C island is due to 2p-2 3d states} this dispersive feature as originating from the resonant Auger decay of the dipole forbidden 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$3d state of the 6-coordinated \ki~cluster to the group of 2p$^{-2}$3d states lying around 2975\,eV. The splitting between the 2p$^{-2}$4p and 2p$^{-2}$3d states in our calculation is smaller than the splitting between the islands B and C. This difference may be due to the fact that we do not account for the effect of the solvent molecules in our calculation.\denis{We talked once about the choice of the geometry for the cluster, that lead to different groups of 3d orbitals. Should we say few words about it here to explain the two 3d groups?? I don't remember if you have calculated the final states for other geometry with let's say 5 water molecules. If yes, I am curious about the relative energy position of the 3d groups (if the splitting is going to be smaller for instnce.
Another remark that is lonked to the following explanation for Cl-: there is one isolated 2p-2 3d state near 2967eV kinetic energy. Does it belong to the 1S term??}


In the Cl$^{0}$(2p$^{-2}$nl) spectrum there are two groups of states split by about 7\,eV (see upper panel of Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_cl}). The lower kinetic energy group corresponds to the 2p$^{-2}$($^1$S)4p states, whereas the higher kinetic energy group corresponds to the 2p$^{-2}$($^1$D)4p states. The splitting between the two groups is in good agreement with the experimental splitting between the dispersive features on the high kinetic energy sides of the $^1$S and $^1$D main peaks. Consequently, we attribute these dispersive features as resulting from the resonant Auger decay of the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p core excited state of \cli~to the 2p$^{-2}$($^1$S)4p and  2p$^{-2}$($^1$D)4p final states.\denis{here I don't understand (including the red sentence right after: you exclude the 3d contributions shown on the spectrum taken at 2825.2eV because the 3d is not populated in the absorption step?}
%
{\color{red} Although the peak at 2382\,eV kinetic energy coincides with the position of the 2p$^{-2}$3d states of the bare \cli~ion, the peak is a result of normal Auger decay, which occurs due to deocalization of the core excited electron. This can be seen on the upper panel of Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_cl}, where it is shown that the position of the peak remains constant as the photon energy increases. Therefore, we conclude that the population of the 2p$^{-2}$3d states is negligible.}


\subsection{Delocalization vs resonant Auger decay}

As mentioned above, the delocalization of core excited electrons in aqueous solutions is ultrafast and as such it competes with the resonant Auger decay. In order to estimate the rate of delocalization of the core excited electron at the pre-edges of \ki~and \cli, we used the core hole clock method. {\color{red}Here, our peaks are not separated as it should be to use the core-hole clock method}


In the case of \cli, a double-peak structure is observed in the interval of kinetic energies 2380 -- 2385\,eV at photon energy corresponding to the lowest core excitation, $h\nu = $2825.2\,eV (Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_cl}, upper panel). The position of the first peak coincides with the main $^1$D line resulting from normal Auger, whereas the second peak at 2383.5\,eV corresponds to the final resonant Auger states 2p$^{-2}$($^1$D)4p. By fitting the peak with two Voigt functions, we determine the ratio of the intensities of these peaks to be $\sim$1. Consequently, the delocalization time is of the same order as the Auger lifetime, i.e.\ $\sim$1\,fs. The fast delocalization in this case is a result of the fact that the energy splitting between the \cli~(1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p) resonance and the ionization threshold is 0.2\,eV, and thus, smaller than the lifetime broadening of 0.62\,eV.


In the case of \ki, the resonant Auger process is faster and moreover, the core excited state appears 1.2\,eV below the ionization threshold, thus one can expect slower delocalization compared to \cli$_{\text{aq}}$. The normal and resonant Auger parts of the peak between 2967 and 2972\,eV taken at the photon energy corresponding to the first resonance are not separated. Thus, the application of the core-hole clock method is not rigorous. Our estimate of the intensity ratio using the core-hole clock method shows that the delocalization at the pre-edge is indeed slower, taking place within 2 -- 3\,fs, compared to the resonant Auger decay, which occurs within 0.9\,fs.


%
%
%The formation of such an island on the 2D map of \ki$_{\text{aq}}$ can result from several processes: shake-up resonant Auger decay, similar to the case of Ar \citep{ceolin15:022502}, spin-orbit splitting in the final states, core-like ICD process, or population of dipole forbidden states, which is a result of symmetry breaking in the presence of the solvent. 
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%
%\item[a)] Shake-up resonant Auger decay
%
%A separate island at 2666\,eV kinetic energy and 3203.5\,eV photon energy is observed on the 2D map of Ar (see Fig.\ 2 in \citep{ceolin15:022502}. This island results from resonant Auger decay of the Ar 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p state to Ar$^{2+}$(2p$^{-2}$4p) states. The 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p state undergoes also shake-up resonant Auger decay, resulting in the population of Ar$^{2+}$(2p$^{-2}$5p) states which appear as a separate feature at the same photon energy, but at lower kinetic energies, 2662\,eV.
%
%
%A similar shake-up decay can be expected for the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p state of \ki. As a first step, we estimate the splitting between the 2p$^{-2}$4p and 2p$^{-2}$5p final states. Using the $(Z+2)$-approximation, the splitting between the 2p$^{-2}$4p and 2p$^{-2}$5p states of K$^{3+}$ is equal to the splitting between the 3p$^6$4p and 3p$^6$5p states of Sc$^{3+}$. From the NIST database \citep{NIST_ASD} for the bare ion we obtain $\sim$8.2\,eV, which agrees with the splitting between the island and the dispersive feature close to the $^1$D main line on the 2D map of \ki$_\text{aq}$ (Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_k}). As a second step, we compare the intensity ratio between the two dispersive features in \ki$_{\text{aq}}$ with that in Ar. As can be seen from Fig.\ \ref{fg:intensity_ratio} the lower-lying peak, which is attributed to the K$^{3+}$(2p$^{-2}$5p) state has higher intensity compared to the higher-lying peak. The intensity of the two peaks in Ar is exactly the opposite implying a lower shake-up probability. Another counterargument against the shake-up origin of the island is that if one compares the maxima of the two dispersive features B and C, one sees that the feature B appears at lower photon energies than C. This is opposed to Ar, where the island originating from normal Auger decay appears at lower photon energies.
%
%Another question is whether the 2p$^{-2}$5p states can be populated in a solution. To address this issue, on Fig.\ \ref{fg:k_2p4nl_raddens} we compare the radial density distributions of the natural orbitals occupied by the excited electron in the K$^{3+}$(2p$^{-2}$4p) and K$^{3+}$(2p$^{-2}$5p) states. The former distribution is quite compact, with 86\% of the electron density within the first solvation shell, whereas only about 20\% of the electron density in the  K$^{3+}$(2p$^{-2}$5p) state is within the first solvation shell.
%
%
%Therefore, we conclude that the features B and C on the 2D map of \ki$_{\text{aq}}$ Fig.\ \ref{fg:2dmap_k} are not a result of a shake-up and normal Auger decay of the \ki(1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p) state.
