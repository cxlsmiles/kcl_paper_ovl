\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:concl}

Using a combination of x-ray absorption and Auger electron spectroscopy, in this work we study the electronic structure of aqueous solution of KCl at the K-edges of both K and Cl. 
The Auger electron spectra of both ions as a function of photon energy exhibit features of normal as well as resonant Auger processes. To interpret the latter we performed {\it ab initio} calculations on microsolvated clusters of \ki~and \cli. Our calculations show that the energy ordering of the 3d and 4p virtual orbitals of \cli~is inverted compared to \ki, and also that the energy splitting between the bright 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p and dark 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$3d core excited states is larger in the former case. These two observations determine the course of the resonant Auger process in the two ions. In the case of \ki, the energetic proximity of the 3d and 4p orbitals in the bare ion results in the dipole forbidden 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$3d state acquiring intensity in a solution as a result of mixing with the dipole allowed 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p excitation. The spectator Auger decay of this mixed state produces an additional dispersive feature which is manifest as a separate island in the Auger electron spectrum. The situation in the case of \cli~is less complicated. The two core excited states mix weakly, and therefore, only fingerprints of the population and Auger decay of dipole allowed states are observed in the spectrum.
