, contrary to what one would expect for a Rydberg series \citep{hussain07:022710}(MORE REF?) and contrary to what is observed for \ki. This phenomenon can be understood by the more compact radial density distribution of the excited electron in the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$5p state compared to that of the 1s$\,\rightarrow\,$4p state shown in Fig.\ \ref{fg:rdens_ions}. As a result of this, the overlap between the core electron and the more compact 5p orbital becomes larger, and thus the oscillator strength of the transition.

The X-ray absorption spectra of the microsolvated clusters of potassium and chlorine were computed at the ground state equilibrium geometries of K$^+$(H$_2$O)$_m$ and \cli(H$_2$O)$_m$, where m = 1, 2, 4, 6. All structures were optimized at the DFT level of theory using the B3LYP functional and the 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set \citep{Krishnan80:650,Blaudeau97:5016}. A frequency analysis was carried out in order to confirm that the obtained geometries are minima on the respective potential energy surfaces. The geometry optimization and frequency analysis were performed with the Gaussian 09 package \citep{g09}. In the case of K$^{+}$(H$_2$O)$_6$ the ground state geometry was obtained by constrained geometry optimization starting with the equilibrium geometry \citep{lee99:3995} belonging to the D$_3$ point group and increasing the angle $\theta$ between the K-O bond and the $C_3$ axis to 55$^{\circ}$. This angle was chosen to be around the maximum in the O-K-O angular distribution obtained from quantum mechanics / molecular mechanics dynamical simulations in Ref.\ \citep{ma14:1006}. {\color{red} the maximum is at 70$^{\circ}$, in our calculation the angle is 90$^{\circ}$} The ground state equilibrium structures are presented in Fig.\ \ref{fg:xas_kcl}. In the case of potassium, they belong to the C$_{2\text{v}}$ (K$^{+}$(H$_2$O)), D$_{2\text{d}}$ (K$^{+}$(H$_2$O)$_2$), S$_4$ (K$^{+}$(H$_2$O)$_4$), and D$_3$ (K$^{+}$(H$_2$O)$_6$) point groups \citep{rao08:12944}. The optimized K-O distances are between 2.638 -- 2.842~\AA, which is in good agreement with other theoretical and experimental works \citep{Ohtaki93:1157,soper06:180,ma14:1006}. In the case of chlorine, the ground state equilibrium 1-, 2- and 6-coordinated structures belong to the C$_{1}$ point group, whereas the 4-coordinated structure belongs to the C$_4$ point group \citep{gora00:7}. The optimized Cl-O distances are between 3.093 -- {\color{red}3.305}~\AA, which is in good agreement with other theoretical and experimental works \citep{ge13:13169,gora00:7,Ohtaki93:1157,soper06:180,ma14:1006}. The 6-coordinated clusters can be considered as representatives of the complete first solvation shell of the two ions \citep{Ohtaki93:1157,soper06:180,ma14:1006}.


The energies and transition moments of the core excited states of the microsolvated clusters were computed with the algebraic diagrammatic construction method for the polarization propagator \citep{sch82:2395} within the core-valence separation approximation \citep{bar85:867,ced80:206,ced81:1038} (CVS-ADC(2)x) as implemented in the Q-Chem package \citep{Wenzel14:1900,Wenzel14:4583,Wormit14:774,QChem2015}. In the case of \cli, the 6-311++G(3df,3pd) basis set \citep{Krishnan80:650,McLean80:5639} (excluding the f functions) was used on all atoms, whereas in the case of \ki, we used the 6-311+G(2d,p) basis set \citep{Krishnan80:650,Blaudeau97:5016} on all atoms, and an additional set of 2s, 2p and 2d diffuse functions was added on K. In our calculations, the core space comprises the 1s orbital of K$^{+}$ or \cli, whereas the remaining occupied orbitals are included in the valence space. For the calculations of the XAS spectra we used the D$_2$ point group in the case of K$^{+}$(H$_2$O)$_2$, the C$_2$ point group in the case of K$^{+}$(H$_2$O)$_4$, K$^{+}$(H$_2$O)$_6$ and \cli(H$_2$O)$_4$. To account for the experimental resolution and for the lifetime broadening due to the Auger decay of the core excited states, we convolved the theoretical spectra with a {\color{red} (Denis, exp. resolution? ) Voigt profile with a Gaussian of FWHM XX\,eV} and a Lorentzian of FWHM 0.74\,eV and 0.62\,eV in the case of \ki~and \cli, respectively \citep{Krause79:329}. We analyzed the core excited states by expanding the singly occupied natural orbitals (SONOs) $\psi_{i}$ of the microsolvated clusters in the basis of SONOs of the bare K$^{+}$ or \cli~ion $\chi_{nl}$
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sono_proj}
\psi_{i} = \sum_{nl} a^{i}_{nl} \chi_{nl}
\end{equation}
%
where $n$ and $l$ stand for the principal and orbital quantum numbers as described in Ref.\ \citep{miteva16:16671}. The expansion coefficients $a^{i}_{nl}$ show the degree of delocalization of the excited electron and the mixing of the core excited states in the crystal field created by the surrounding water molecules (see Fig.\ \ref{fg:xas_kcl}).


The final states following KLL resonant Auger decay of K$^{+}$ and \cli~were computed at the Configuration Interaction Singles (CIS) level using the Graphical Unitary Group Approach (GUGA) as implemented in the GAMESS-US package \citep{GUGA_PhysScr_21,GUGA_JCP_70,GUS}. We used the 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set \citep{Blaudeau97:5016} augmented with 2s, 2p, 2d diffuse functions on \ki, and the cc-pVTZ basis set augmented with 6s, 6p, 6d diffuse KBJ functions \citep{Kaufmann89:2223} on \cli. The active space comprises the 2s and 2p orbitals of K/Cl with occupancy fixed to 6 and all virtual orbitals with occupancy fixed to 1. The remaining doubly occupied orbitals were frozen in the calculation. \citep{mosnier16:061401}
