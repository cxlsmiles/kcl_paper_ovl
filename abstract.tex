Auger electron spectroscopy is a powerful tool to probe the electronic structure and immediate surroundings of ions in a solution. In this work we use a combination of x-ray absorption and Auger electron spectroscopies to study the electronic structure of aqueous KCl at the K-edges of \ki~and \cli. Although the two ions are isoelectronic, their Auger electron spectra as a function of the photon energy exhibit notably different features. To explain these differences, we carried out {\it ab initio} calculations of both the core excited states and the final Auger states of \ki, \cli~and their microsolvated clusters. Our calculations show that the energy order of the 3d and 4p orbitals is inverted in \ki~with respect to \cli. The reverse orbital order in the two ions not only influences their x-ray absorption spectra, but also impacts the course of the subsequent resonant Auger processes.
